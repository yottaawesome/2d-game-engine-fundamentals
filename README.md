# 2D Game Engine Fundamentals

## Introduction

Working through Udemy's [Fundamentals of 2D Game Engines with C++ SDL and Lua course](https://www.udemy.com/course/cpp-2d-game-engine/).

## Ubuntu setup

Though I'm primarily a Windows developer, I've decided to follow along the instructor's recommendation to do the course in a Linux-based environment (I may consider porting it to a Windows setup after completion). The repo requires a number of dependencies to be satisfied, which are listed below in the form of commands for Ubuntu's package manager.

```bash
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev
sudo apt install libsdl2-image-dev
sudo apt install libsdl2-ttf-dev
sudo apt install libsdl2-mixer-dev
sudo apt install liblua5.3-dev
```
